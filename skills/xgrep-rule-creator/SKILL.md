# xgrep Rule Creator

Create production-quality xgrep rules with proper testing and validation. Also port existing rules to new target languages.

## When to Use

- Writing xgrep rules for specific bug patterns or security vulnerabilities
- Writing taint mode rules for data flow vulnerabilities
- Writing rules to enforce coding standards
- Porting an existing rule to one or more new target languages

## When NOT to Use

- Running existing rulesets (just use `xgrep -f rules.yaml target/`)
- Triaging scan findings (use the `xgrep-triage` skill)

## Detecting Intent

**From scratch** (default): The user describes a vulnerability or pattern to detect.
**Porting**: The user provides an existing rule file AND specifies target language(s). Follow the porting workflow in [workflow.md]({baseDir}/references/workflow.md#porting-an-existing-rule).

## Rationalizations to Reject

- **"The pattern looks complete"** -- Still run `xgrep test` to verify. Untested rules have hidden false positives/negatives.
- **"It matches the vulnerable case"** -- Matching vulnerabilities is half the job. Verify safe cases don't match (false positives break trust).
- **"Taint mode is overkill"** -- If data flows from user input to a dangerous sink, taint mode gives better precision than pattern matching.
- **"One test is enough"** -- Include edge cases: different coding styles, sanitized inputs, safe alternatives, boundary conditions.
- **"It passes the tests, so it's done"** -- a rule can be correct and still be a
  defect. Correctness and cost are separate properties, and the tests only measure
  the first. Check what the rule costs on a real codebase (workflow.md Step 5).
- **"I'll optimize first"** -- Write correct patterns first, optimize after all tests pass. Premature optimization causes regressions.
- **"The rule found nothing, so the code is clean"** -- Far more often the rule is
  silently broken. A rule that validates and reports nothing is the single most
  common failure mode; see *Silent-Failure Anti-Patterns* in
  [workflow.md]({baseDir}/references/workflow.md#silent-failure-anti-patterns) and
  work down the diagnosis checklist before believing a zero.

## Anti-Patterns

**Read [Silent-Failure Anti-Patterns]({baseDir}/references/workflow.md#silent-failure-anti-patterns) before writing taint rules.** Those five produce
*no* finding rather than a wrong one, so a green `validate` and a passing fixture
do not rule them out: a trailing `...` binds only the last argument; an
out-parameter source without `focus-metavariable` taints nothing reachable; a
bare call pattern also matches the declaration; folding `pattern-inside`
alternatives collapses seeding to one finding per file; and a shape rule tagged
`subcategory: vuln` inflates the false-positive rate instead.

**Too broad** -- matches everything:
```yaml
# BAD: Matches any function call
pattern: $FUNC(...)

# GOOD: Specific dangerous function
pattern: eval(...)
```

**Missing safe cases in tests** -- undetected false positives:
```python
# BAD: Only tests vulnerable case
# ruleid: my-rule
dangerous(user_input)

# GOOD: Include safe cases
# ruleid: my-rule
dangerous(user_input)

# ok: my-rule
dangerous(sanitize(user_input))

# ok: my-rule
dangerous("hardcoded_safe_value")
```

**Using regex when AST patterns are better**:
```yaml
# BAD: Matches inside strings and comments
pattern-regex: "eval\\(.*\\)"

# GOOD: AST-aware matching
pattern: eval(...)
```

**A taint rule whose sink has no distinctive literal** -- scans everything:
```yaml
# BAD: the source is one of the most common forms in the language, and the sink
# is punctuation plus a 3-letter type keyword. Engines pre-filter candidate files
# using the literal tokens in your SINK pattern; `int` is too short and too
# common to filter on, so no file can be excluded and taint gets seeded at every
# `&x` in the codebase.
mode: taint
pattern-sources:
  - pattern: "& $V"          # address-of: one of the most common forms in C
pattern-sinks:
  - pattern: "*((int*)$P)"   # usable literal tokens: none

# GOOD: give the sink a token worth pre-filtering on, or narrow the source so it
# is not seeded everywhere.
mode: taint
pattern-sources:
  - patterns:
    - pattern: "char $V = ...;"
    - pattern-inside: "$FUNC(...) { ... }"
pattern-sinks:
  - pattern: "read_as_int($P)"
```
This shape is pathological on any large codebase: the vast majority of files
cannot contain the sink, but nothing tells the engine that, so the rule seeds
taint in all of them. Expect it to dominate scan time and return little.

**Overly specific** -- misses variations:
```yaml
# BAD: Only matches exact format
pattern: os.system("rm " + $VAR)

# GOOD: Taint tracking catches all flows
mode: taint
pattern-sources:
  - pattern: input(...)
pattern-sinks:
  - pattern: os.system(...)
```

## Strictness Level

This workflow is **strict** -- do not skip steps:
- **Test-first is mandatory**: Never write a rule without tests
- **100% test pass required**: "Most tests pass" is not acceptable
- **Optimize last**: Only simplify patterns after all tests pass
- **Avoid generic patterns**: Rules must be specific
- **Prefer taint mode** for data flow vulnerabilities
- **One YAML file, one rule**: Don't combine multiple rules in a single file
- **No generic language**: Avoid `languages: generic` when targeting a specific language
- **No `todoruleid`**: Don't use `todoruleid` annotations as a crutch for unfinished rules

## Overview

Rules are created iteratively: analyze the problem, write tests first, write the rule, iterate until all tests pass, then optimize.

**Approach selection:**
- **Taint mode** (prefer for injection/flow bugs): Tracks data from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks
- **Pattern matching**: Simple syntactic patterns without data flow requirements

**Switching approaches**: If taint mode isn't working well (propagation issues, too many FPs), switch to pattern matching. If pattern matching has too many FPs on safe cases, try taint mode. The goal is a working rule.

**Output structure** -- rule + clean source file + Go table test:
```
rules/<lang>/lang/security/<category>/<rule-id>/
+-- <rule-id>.xgrep.yaml     # xgrep rule
+-- <rule-id>.<ext>           # Clean source file (no annotations)

test/rules/<lang>/security_test.go   # Go test with ExpectMatch lines
```

- `docs/contributing/secure-coding.md` -- Dangerous vs safe patterns per language
- `rules/<lang>/.../<rule>/` -- existing rules per language (the live source of coverage)

## Quick Start

```yaml
rules:
  - id: insecure-eval
    languages: [python]
    severity: ERROR
    message: User input passed to eval() allows code execution
    mode: taint
    pattern-sources:
      - pattern: request.args.get(...)
    pattern-sinks:
      - pattern: eval(...)
```

Source file (`insecure-eval.py`) -- clean, no annotations:
```python
from flask import request

def vulnerable(request):
    eval(request.args.get('code'))

def safe():
    eval("print('safe')")
```

Go test (`test/rules/python/security_test.go`):
```go
func TestPythonInsecureEval(t *testing.T) {
    dir := filepath.Join(rulesDir(), "python", "lang", "security", "injection", "insecure-eval")
    testutil.RunRuleTest(t, testutil.RuleTest{
        Rule: filepath.Join(dir, "insecure-eval.xgrep.yaml"),
        Cases: []testutil.TestCase{
            {File: "insecure-eval.py", ExpectMatch: []int{4}},
        },
    })
}
```

Run: `go test ./test/rules/python/ -run TestPythonInsecureEval -v`

## Workflow Checklist

Copy and track progress:

```
xgrep Rule Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the problem
- [ ] Step 2: Write tests first
- [ ] Step 3: Write the rule
- [ ] Step 4: Iterate until all tests pass (go test ./test/rules/<lang>/)
- [ ] Step 5: Optimize the rule (remove redundancies, re-test)
- [ ] Step 5b: Measure its COST on a real codebase (`--time`; seconds-per-finding)
- [ ] Step 6: Final validation (xgrep validate + real-world scan)
- [ ] Step 7: Confirm it is not silently broken — every clause contributes a
      match, and the rule fires on a realistic target, not just the fixture
```

**Step 7 is not optional for taint rules.** `validate` checks syntax; it cannot
tell a precise rule from one that matches nothing. Verify each source pattern and
each sink pattern fires on its own before trusting the combined rule, and check
the finding count on a real project — a rule that is correct on a 20-line
fixture and silent on a real codebase is the normal shape of these bugs.
